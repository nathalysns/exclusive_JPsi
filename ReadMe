#This folder contains the Module and post-processing scripts of the ep->JPsip->eep channel

#1. The src folder contains the excl_ana module to read the information of the DST_Reader
# To compile it:
# In the singularity container load the environment
 source setup.csh 
#go to the src folder and create a build folder
 cd src
 mkdir build
 ../autogen.sh  --prefix=$MYINSTALL
 make install  

#2, to use the Module use the macro: macros/Fun4All_exclusive.C
# it only use the number of events, input DST file and output file 
#   -1 runs all the events. Example 
 root -l -b -q .x Fun4All_exclusive.C\(100,\"/work/eic/users/nathaly/jobs/exclusive/rootfiles/JPsi_e18_p275_205.root\",\"out.root\"\)

#This creates a root file with the events that are read. I add all the events and form the rootfile JPsi_all.root in the rootfiles folder
